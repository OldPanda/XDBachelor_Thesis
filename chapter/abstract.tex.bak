    随着信息技术的发展，人们对信息安全的需求越来越高。与传统方法相比，生物认证技术具有安全、稳定的优势，逐渐成为了保障信息安全的主流方法。而非接触式的掌纹识别技术以其使用方便、掌纹特征明显的优势逐渐成为了研究的热点，目前许多学者已经提出了各种行之有效的掌纹特征匹配方法。之前大部分研究集中在后期的特征匹配，而背景去除作为掌纹识别过程中重要的一环并没有得到太多的关注，受复杂背景的限制，掌纹识别系统在生活中的应用还不是很广泛。本文提出了一种对不同光照强度及复杂背景具有鲁棒性的背景去除方法。本文的手掌图像数据库通过普通手机拍摄收集建立，拍摄环境尽可能多样。在YCbCr空间用Laws' masks提取图像的纹理及模糊特征，并加入了邻域特征。将这些特征和目标来训练支持向量机，用得到的训练模型对测试样本进行分类。实验证明，与其他方法相比，本文的方法能在复杂环境下分割出更加清晰的掌形图像，最高分类正确率达到了94.69\%。

With the rapid development of information techniques, the security of users' information is increasingly desired. Compared with traditional security mechanisms, biometric identification has a great advantage of security and consistency and is becoming the mainstream of protection of information. Since people mainly focused on the palmprint matching phase before, the background removal, which is an important part of palmprint recognition system, in preprocessing phase didn't draw much attention. Therefore, the use of the technique in our daily life is limited by complex background. In this paper, a novel method is proposed that is robust to the varying illumination and changing environment. The image database used in this paper is comprised of photos taken by a mobile phone with as many kinds of backgrounds as possible. Then we extract texture features and haze features in YCbCr color space and neighbor features are added to increase the accuracy. And we can get support vector machine trained and predict the test set using the trained model. According to the experiment result, our algorithm is frequently able to segment the hand out of complex environment with a fairly nice hand shape which reached the accuracy of 94.69\%.
